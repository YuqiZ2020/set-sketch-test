# MATLAB GUI to run SetKetch

This is a MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can run SetKetch. The set estimation result will be compared with true values that are computed through brute force.

Steps involved in the calculation are shown in the Figure folder. 

## SetSketch
The original algorithm by Otmar Ertl was presented in the paper ["SetSketch: Filling the Gap between MinHash and HyperLogLog"](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2244-ertl.pdf) which was accepted at [VLDB 2021](https://vldb.org/2021/). An [extended paper version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00314) that includes mathematical proofs and additional results is available on arXiv. The author's [original implementation](https://github.com/dynatrace-research/set-sketch-paper) in C++ and additional Python visualization tools is available on Github.
